You may have judgements against me or my team, but that’s okay because we’ve developed our “Behind the N” series which recounts our failures and successes over the past six years.

I was once a struggling agent who sold just one home in 2008, but now our team sells over 400 homes per year. We want to give back and share our failures and successes so you can learn from them and navigate your own career.

“Behind the N” is a live event hosted by me, and **there are only 39 seats available, so you’ll need to sign up quickly if you’d like to attend.** At this event, you can get to know me and I can get to know you, and together we can go over what’s working in your business.

I promise you that I’ll bring you as much value as I can in the shortest period of time. In the meantime, I hope to see you there!

If you have any other questions about our “Behind the N” series, don’t hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d love to speak with you.
