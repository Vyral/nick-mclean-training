**[SIGN UP FOR THE EVENT HERE](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/behind-the-n-tickets-46111800637)**

You are invited to my upcoming, live event “Behind the N” series. Whether you are a licensed real estate agent or not, I would love to see you there. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Do you wonder how I grew my team to sell more than a home a day for over two straight years? **My team continues to grow, in fact, as we are on pace to sell over 400 homes this year.** But, looking at who we are today does not tell you how we got here.<br>&nbsp;<br>This is why I am hosting this event—so I can show you how I went from selling a single home my first year to our current record. I will go over what we are doing right, and what we have done wrong over the years because I want to give back to the Realtor community.<br>&nbsp;<br>**One of my passions in real estate is training.** We train an hour a day Monday through Thursday and I look forward to it greatly because it is when I get to give back and see people grow, learn, and implement. I love seeing people implement new tools and strategies that have helped me in my real estate career.

{% include pullquote.html %}<br>&nbsp;<br>Many people have given to me and now it is time for me to give back. So, we are doing the "Behind the N" series where you can learn about our lessons learned and take away different nuggets you can implement into your own business in North Central Washington.<br>&nbsp;<br>**We truly believe in an abundance mindset rather than a scarcity mindset,** so the more we give to our local community or Realtors, the more homes we will have on the market and the more buyers that are going to be interested in real estate.<br>&nbsp;<br>The event is limited seating—**only 39 people can attend.** So, **[sign up today on Eventbrite for our June 21 for our first ever "Behind the N" series event.](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/behind-the-n-tickets-46111800637)**<br>&nbsp;<br>If you have any further questions about this event, please feel free to contact me by phone or email. I would be happy to answer your questions. Hope to see you in June!
